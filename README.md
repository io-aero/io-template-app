## Converting the application into an executable file

### 1. Common Characteristics

This section details characteristics of `docker2exe` when used to convert the `io-template-app` into an executable file. These features are crucial for understanding the overall approach and platform-specific considerations necessary for the conversion process.

- **Target Platforms**:
The tools support creating executables specifically for macOS, Ubuntu, or Windows. This allows for precise targeting based on deployment needs.

- **Platform-Specific Build**:
The process of creating an executable is required to be conducted on the operating system for which the executable is intended. This means building a Windows executable on a Windows machine, a macOS executable on a macOS machine, and so on.

- **Use of Makefile**:
`docker2exe` utilize the Makefile of `iotemplateapp` to facilitate the construction of executables. 

### 2. Using docker2exe

**a. The prerequisites are:**

- Go Programming Language: `docker2exe` is developed in Go, so Go must be installed on the system to either compile from source or run the pre-compiled binaries.
- Docker: Docker is required as `docker2exe` converts Docker images into executable files.

The executable files for `docker2exe` are downloaded from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/rzane/docker2exe). Note that the executable for Windows has been renamed to `docker2exe-windows-amd64.exe` and is located in the `dist` directory of the application. Visit the [docker2exe tool page](https://github.com/rzane/docker2exe) for more details and to access the source code.

**b. Creating the Executable File**

- Run `make docker`

- The Docker image named `iotemplateapp` is first created.
 
- `docker2exe` is then used to convert the Docker image into an executable file.

- A directory is finally created containing all the files necessary for running the application. The name of this directory varies depending on the operating system and architecture:
    - **macOS**: `app-darwin-amd64` or `app-darwin-arm64`
    - **Ubuntu**: `app-linux-amd64`
    - **Windows**: `app-windows-amd64`

- The directory, in addition to the executable file (`iotemplateapp` or `iotemplateapp.exe`), includes the following components:
    - **data**: A directory for the application data.
    - **logging_cfg.yaml**: A configuration file for logging.
    - **run_io_templateapp.[bat|sh|zsh]**: A shell script to run the application.
    - **settings.io-aero.toml**: Configuration data for the `iotemplateapp`.

- The converted application requires Docker to be installed in order to run, ensuring that the application's environment is appropriately replicated.
